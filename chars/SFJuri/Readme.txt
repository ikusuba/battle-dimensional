=====<Gameplay Notes>=====
- Fuhaijin projectile can be held and released later, ex version you cannot hold
- When Ex kastushi starts u can hold down which direction she goes (Back to go back, Up To go up and Fwd to go fwd)
- Her cancels are mostly similar to ssfiv where she can only cancel normals into specials

CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
