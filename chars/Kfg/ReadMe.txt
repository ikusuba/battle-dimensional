---------------<Character Info>------------------

(**Note: 1-10 Ranking System: 1 = Lowest, 10 = Best)

 - Intelligence: 5
 - Strength: 3
 - Speed: 8
 - Stamina: 3
 - Energy Projection: 1
 - Fighting Ability: 4

Apparently the female version of Kung Fu Man. Not nearly as balanced and sturdy as him, being female and all.
Also, it seems that she hasn't particularly mastered her fighting style. As a result, her techniques
are weaker strength wise than Kung Fu Man's. However, being female, her agility and comboing ability far- 
surpasses Kung Fu Man. Be extra careful when fighting as the lovely Kung Fu Girl, because she's not
very good at taking a hit... Even more so than your average female fighter. Making use of her high dexterity
and combo abilities will be essential in overcoming your foes.

--------------------<Q&A>------------------------

 Q: Why Kung Fu Girl?
 A: I don't know honestly... Just because I suppose. Sprite work is really good and didn't want
    KFM to be all alone out there. =P

 Q: Can I use something from this char?
 A: Coding is always at your disposal. As for her sprites themselves... I can't actually GIVE you permission
    to use them as you see fit. I just used them because I wanted to, though I didn't make them obviously. 
    I'm assuming the original creator of this particular version of her, S.Y.D, made the sprites. As long
    as credit is given to S.Y.D for the sprites, I don't see a problem. And even if there is... Well, I
    don't see why, because MUGEN is for everybody. Just give credit where credit is due. You'd be better
    off getting S.Y.D's version in terms of sprite usage though, because I deleted all sprites I wasn't going to use.

 Q: What can we expect from you next?
 A: One may never know...

 Q: What stage/music do you use for Kung Fu Girl? 
 A: I don't know... Nothing in particular, sorry...   

 Q: Can I make a patch/AI for Kung Fu Girl?
 A: Sure. 

 Q: Why the *sigh* about her perfect winpose?
 A: So much fanservice... I personally don't like doing this, though as long as it's tasteful/funny,
    and not porn based, I can go along with it. I kinda didn't want to, but I eventually decided to go ahead
    and do it. However, you gotta earn it by getting a perfect. =P

 Q: Why did you leave out some of her other moves that are in S.Y.D's version?
 A: I'm not one for joke/novelty/unbalanced chars and moves. Tis why I made my own version of her.
    She's not Yamazaki, Krizalid, Kenshiro, etc. It's funny and all, that's nice, but it's not my thing.
    You can always get S.Y.D's version if you want those moves. Or create your own version of her. PLEASE
    do not request or ask me to add them, because I won't, and it'll be a waste of your time.

 Q: Blah, blah, blah Ikemen/1.1?!
 A: I DO NOT make stuff for either one of those. 
    Do NOT tell me anything about them.

 - Honestly, I don't know if Elecbyte actually made Kung Fu Girl, or if she's fan made... Either way, the rights
   to her aren't mine, and I don't claim them to be. She's the property of whoever owns her rights. I just coded
   my own version of her for MUGEN, that's it.
