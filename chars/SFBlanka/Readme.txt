=====<Move Details>=====

 - Amazon River Run and Coward Crouch can be used to dodge non-low projectiles.
 - Raid Jump has a difference jump arc in relation to his other jumps.
 - Wild Lift is a launcher and you can juggled after if you connect.
 - You can cancel your normals into Surprise Forward/Back to control the distance.
 - The last button used when performing Electric Thunder determines its strength. If it is two punch
   buttons the EX version is triggered.
 - EX Rolling Attack goes through projectiles during active frames.
 - EX Backstep Roll has invincibility during startup. Use it to gtfo of the corner.
 - EX Vertical Roll has invincibility during startup.

=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Command, Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage

CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
