Overall Mai is your typical female character. Fast and nimble, great comboing abilty.
Though, she falls short in terms of raw power and endurance. If you don't keep your
guard up, you'll find yourself getting KO'd fast... Even so, her high dexterity and
great linking abilities more than make up for this.

--------------------<Q&A>------------------------

 Q: Why Mai?
 A: Because she told me she loved me.

 Q: Can I use something from this char?
 A: Yup, use w/e you need.

 Q: What stage/music do you use for Mai? 
 A: I use a stage created by Kung Fu Man at RandomSelect. It's Andy/Mai's stage from "Real Bout Fatal Fury Special".
    As for the music, I won't be adding music to chars anymore. It's just increases the file size. You'll use w/e
    bgm you want anyway. =P    

 Q: Can I make a patch for Mai?
 A: Sure.  

 Q: Blah, blah, blah Ikemen/1.1?!
 A: I DO NOT make stuff for either one of those. 
    Do NOT tell me anything about them.

-----------------<Possible Extra Stuff>---------------------

 - Add new Lv3 Super "Kubi no Kitsune" (maybe) 
 - Fix any issues based on feedback
 
------------------<Special Notes>--------------------------

In Mai's "Extra" folder, there are some additional special states made by Lows9.0 that I didn't implement.
I'm not too fond of said states and I'm also very lazy. :P They're there though if you want to add/use them.
