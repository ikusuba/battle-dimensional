The Psycho Soldier of fortune, Athena Asamiya. Pretty all around char, though lacking in defense.
As is such with most female chars. Good anti air defense, projectiles, speed, and other strong suits that-
make her a great char. Very good at rush downs and putting pressure on opponents, despite her adorable looks.
Make full use of it all to devastate your foes.
