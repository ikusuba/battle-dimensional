=====<Move Details>=====

 - Hyochu Wari is an overhead. (except when canceled into)
 - EX Hien Shippukyaku can be juggled afterwards with any attack; however, this can only be done once per combo.
 - Zanretsuken has autoguard.
 - You can cancel out of Kyokugenryu Renbuken after the final hit by performing a high jump; this also resets
   your juggle points.
 - EX Kyokugenryu Renbuken is an unblockable throw. It can also be juggled afterwards with any attack; however,
   this can only be done once per combo.
 - Tenchi Haohken instantly dizzies the opponent on hit.



=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Command, Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Canceling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start



=====<Version History>=====

<RagingRowen's Edit>

June 6th 2021:
 - Added invincibility before the attack frames of EX Kyokugenryu Renbuken.

Original Release:
 - EX Mode added.
 - Multi-Colored Hitsparks added.
 - lieDown.time decreased to 30.
 - Hyochu Wari knockback increased.
 - Zanretsuken Simul crash fixed.
 - Tenchi Haohken more impactful with Shockwave FX.

To Do:

 - Clean-Up CS
 - Get/Find and CS Custom Sprites (KOF Hien Shippukyaku, Kohou Shippuken)

<???>
 - reduced hitspark size by 65%
 - new animation for LP/MP zanretsuken finish
 - non-ex renbuken acts like cvs2 (ie, high jump cancel instead of free juggle), damage dampener for ex renbuken
   and ex shippukyaku rebalanced
 - fixed bug where you could cancel out of zanretsuken early during custom combo

<04/12/14>
 - Removed a bug where an opponent hit from behind by Zanretsuken/Ryuko Ranbu would face the wrong way
 - Fixed an error involving corner push being applied twice
 - MAX Haoh Shokoken now disappears when all hits were done

<02/16/14>
 - Zanretsuken no longer does chip damage, preventing bug when cheap KO'd by it
 - Hitvels for HP Zanretsuken slightly changed again
 - Throw attempt animation time reduced
 - Rapid-fire chaining rules now follow Ryo's CvS2 appearance
 - Damage dampener for EX Hien Shippukyaku/Kyogukenryu Renbuken slightly reduced
 - Fixed bug where the first hit of EX Kyogukenryu Renbuken would not increase the hit count 
 - EX Kyoguken Renbuken damage slightly increased

<02/04/14>
 - Hitvels for Zanretsuken changed, can now do connect LP Haoh Shokoken from HP Zanretsuken; canceling from
   non-HP into Zannretsuken to Ryuko Ranbu looks less awkward
 - Fixed sound channel issue for MAX Haoh Shokoken
 - Trip no longer sends P2 into a custom state
 - Dizzy time from Tenchi Haohken significantly reduced
 - Dizzy sound is now from CvS2
 - The minimum amount of damage Zanretsuken and Ryuko Ranbu does was reduced
 - EX Hien Shippukyaku damage slightly increased, now uses the Art of Fighting "pow" sound

<01/31/14>
 - First release
