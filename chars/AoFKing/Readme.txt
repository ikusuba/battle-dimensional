=====<Move Details>=====

 - Surprise Rose can juggle off of Mirage Kick if done in the corner
 - EX Mirage Kick can be juggled afterwards with any attack; however, this can only be done once per combo.
 - The button (or combination of buttons) used to activate Phantom Strike determines at whether King will start
   the attack by firing a low, mid, or high level projectile


=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Command, Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage

CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start



=====<Version History>=====

<11/29/21>
 - fixed minor guard input bug

<12/31/19>
 - fixed bug where opponents would regain control after the first hit of Trap Shot when used during Custom Combo.
 - fixed bug where opponents could not block Secret Mirage if they were not already blocking.
 - Venom Strike buffed: reduced recovery by 8 ticks, increased projectile speed
 - very slight changes to super invincibility

<09/27/17>
 - Added the EXPLODsive Buffering system, by me and JustNoPoint
 - The second Double Strike projectile can juggle from the first projectile.
 - Changed Phantom Strike behavior to better match KOF: opponent stays locked in place for the initial hits, then is knocked away
   when hit by the final projectile. Projectiles can also juggle off one another to a limited extent (all projectiles are capable of
   juggling from one another, but the opponent is unlikely to be hit by more than 2 to 3 due to their HitVels)
 - minor get hit AnimType changes

<01/30/17>
 - Added projectile reflection compatibility
 - Added compatibility with the Reigi no Ishizue super from Vans's Chizuru
 - Cleaned up various projectile coding

<01/06/17>
 - First release
