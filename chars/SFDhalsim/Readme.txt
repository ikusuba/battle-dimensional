=====<Sally Selection>=====

This character can choose to include Dhalsim's wife, Sally to cheer him on. In this character's folder, there is a file called "Config.txt". Choose whether you want her to be in the background by editing it like in the following example: 
  
[State 7650, 0 = No Sally; 1 = Yes Sally]
type = ParentVarSet
trigger1 = 1
var(40) = 0 ;CHANGE THIS LINE
 
This means that Sally will not be there. To make her appear in matches, simply change the number to the right of "var(40) = " like in the following example: 
 
[State 7650, 0 = No Sally; 1 = Yes Sally]
type = ParentVarSet
trigger1 = 1
var(40) = 1 ;CHANGE THIS LINE

=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage

CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start



=====<Miscellaneous>=====

- To change his size to TV aspect ratio (a.k.a. CvS scale), open the .def file and replace
  "Constants.cns" with "ConstantsCvS.cns".

- To change his voice to use English SFIV voices, open the .def file and replace "Sound.snd" with
  "SoundSFIVEnglish.snd"

- If you don't like having to use 3p/3k to perform moves, open the .def file and replace
  "Command.cmd" with "CommandEasy.cmd".
  The new commands will be as follows:
	.Yoga Teleport (Forward):		F, D, DF, x + y / x + z / y + z / a + b / b + c / a + c / z + b
	.Yoga Teleport (Backward):		B, D, DB, x + y / x + z / y + z / a + b / b + c / a + c / z + b
