=====<MOVE DETAILS>=====

 - During Homura-geri, you and your opponent can mash buttons to respectively increase or
decrease the number of hits;

 - Hou Shou has autoguard at the start;

 - EX Yasha Gaeshi can be jump cancelled if it connects;

 - Kisaki no Kakou will only connect properly on a standing or crouching opponent;

 - During Kira Esei Neraiuchi you must input the next command just as Karin hits the opponent;



=====<GAMEPLAY NOTES>=====

COMBO SYSTEM
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Super moves can be canceled into other Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points


DAMAGE SCALING
 - The damage your attacks inflict goes down with each attack in a combo
 - The first attack deals 100% damage
 - Successive attacks deal 10% less damage
 - Super cancelling a special advances 2 steps in the damage scaling
 - Super cancelling a super advances 3 steps in the damage scaling
 - Damage during Custom Combo works the same, but multiplied by 75%


COUNTER HITS
 - If the opponent is in the middle of attacking, your attacks deal 20% extra damage
 - Normal attacks cause extra hit stun as well, allowing links that are normally not possible
 - You'll know a counter hit happened when a round shockwave effect appears at the point of impact


RUN
 - Can be interrupted with any attack


BACK DASH
 - Creates some space between you and the opponent
 - Considered airborne, so it avoids most throws and standing combos


LOW JUMP
 - Useful for quick jumping attacks that must be blocked high
 - Cannot use special and super moves while low jumping
 - Delay after attacking is longer than other jumps


HIGH JUMP
 - Useful for quickly closing distance
 - If the opponent is in the corner, this allows you to cross him up


LONG LOW JUMP
 - A cross between Low and High jumps


ROLL
 - Avoids all attacks and fireballs while moving
 - Vulnerable to throws
 - Can be hit by anything at the end of the animation
 - Forward version is a bit faster than the back version


PARRY
 - Allows you to bypass block stun, leaving the opponent open for a counterattack
 - To parry high attacks tap forward just before being hit. To parry low attacks tap down. While jumping only forward works


POWER CHARGE
 - Manually charges the power meter
 - Rate of charge is slow at first, but increases the longer you hold it


GUARD CANCEL
 - While guarding, this cancels out of the guarding pose with a counterattack
 - Useful to relieve pressure


CUSTOM COMBO
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start


FALL RECOVERY
 - Allows you to land on your feet after being knocked down


ROLL RECOVERY
 - Allows you to sneak up behind the opponent after being knocked down
 - Completely vulnerable to throws and low attacks
 - Holding forward makes you travel farther



=====<MISCELLANEOUS>=====

 - Holding down a button as Karin wins a round allows you to select her win pose;
