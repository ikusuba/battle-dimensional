=====<Move Details>=====

 - On counter hit One Inch Punch wall bounces P2, except when command canceled, along with reseting the juggle points.
 - Knee Assault is an overhead (except when canceled into).
 - EX Minutes Spike has autoguard.
 - Secondary Bites has Low hit detection.
 - EX Black Out is completely invincible.
 - Heat Drive and MAX Heat Drive are unguardables if they're fully charged.


=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage

CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start



=====<Version History>=====

<RagingRowen's 2021 Update>
- More damage changes. 
- Normal Knee Assault has longer startup.
- Minute Spikes launch lower and Ground versions cause less x-velocity knockback, with EX Air having the least. Only Air versions are juggle-viable.
- Normal Narrow Spike launches lower while EX launches higher. EX is intended to be the one to juggle from.
(The previous 2 changes are based on XIII and XIV combos).
- Removed Heat Drive MAX Cancelling, couldn't do much in source material.

<RagingRowen's Second Update>
- Some Damage rebalances.
- Misc. Tweaks.

<RagingRowen's Update>
- Stance Animation acts like in XIII (Skips to the Hands on Hips (w/e you call it) part after Walking).
- Run Step Sounds fixed.
- Added Multi-Colored Hit Sparks.
- Added Missing Custom Combo Sparks.
- MAX Cancels fixed/added (The added part goes to Heat Drive).
- EX Second Shell has faster recovery.
- Fixed Non-EX Crow Bites using Kick Hitsounds.
- Air Minutes Spike y-velocity changed.
- EX Black Out has better invincibility.
- Crimson Star Road is a Level 3 and has various visual differences including the Super Spark playing mid-super like in 2K2UM.
- Several minor fixes and changes I may have forgot.
