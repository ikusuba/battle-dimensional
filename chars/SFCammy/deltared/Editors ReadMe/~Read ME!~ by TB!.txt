| Cammy - Delta Red |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
~Edited by Tiger-Boy!~

This is an edit version of the Cammy Delta Red char by chuchoryu and Varo_Hades, using the char base from POTS (phantom of the server), so all credit goes to them.

How can you help?:
I know many of you are 'details-freaks' like myself. And even if I edited this Cammy pcx by pcx, I might have overlooked something.
If you find any image out of place, edited wrongly, or even have an advice, let me know.

This has been quite the great experience. 
All I wanted to do was to make a SSF2 ending for this Cammy. 
Ended up editing the char itself to a level I never thought I could.
I've learned a lot along the way, and I'm still learning.

Any feedback (good or bad), advices, and even ideas, will be appreciated.

01/19/2014:

-Re-Edited her SF4 stand animation:
	-smoothed her arms animations.
	-Make her left arm be more 'outward'.
	-Worked on some 'shadow' details.

	-smoothed her arms animations.
	-Worked on some 'shadow'/muscle-tone details.
-Added and edited her 'salute' intro when facing Guile, Nash(Charlie), and Leona.
 Edited animations to fit both stances.
 (You may want to edit your Guile/Nash/Leona Char to salute her back.)
-Edited her SF2 Ending (more updated sprites of Cammy).
-Now you can choose Cammy's 'Age' (Size)! Check her DEF file:
 
 ;************************************
 ;Choose Cammy's Age!
 ;Remove ";" from the desired one.
 ;Add ";" in front of the other 2.

 ;cns     =Constants/Constants-SF2.cns;SF2 Age
 cns     =Constants/Constants-SF4.cns;SF4 Age

 ;************************************

"To Do" List:

-Add Military Boots. (ChuchoRyu mention he was working on this. Thanks!)
-Add more Intros and Win animations.
-Make a Color Separation patch.
-Add Cammy's Psycho effect colors into the palette scheme. (Probable.)
-New 'Super Combo'(Gyro Drive Smasher?).

-----------------------------------------------------:

01/07/2015:

-Due to popular demand, I am releasing her as a full char, instead of a patch. (Aproved by Varo Hades)
-Edited 'Electro-Shock' animation.
-Edited a few sprites (small details).
-Changed all Sprites that were not edited by ChuchoRyu. Now she is FULLY Delta Red!
-Fixed her vertical spinning heel images (Up and down). 
-New 'Hyper' portrait. (Thanks again, Hades!)


"To Do" List:
-Fix her 'leg throw' attacks (Frankensteiner).
-Add Military Boots. (Long term. Don't expect it any time soon...)
-Add Intro when facing Guile/Charlie/Nash.
-Add Intros and Win animations.
-Add Cammy's Psycho effect colors into the palette scheme. (Probable.)
-Make a Color Separation patch.
-New 'Super Combo'(Gyro Drive Smasher?).

12/31/2014:

-Edited her Victory Quotes. Now not only she has several General Quotes, she also has specific quotes when defeating certain chars (Mostly Street Fighter).
-Changed her small Portrait (Thanks to Hades).
-Added Victory Portrait (9000,2 - 320x125).
-Fixed the issue with the colors on her glove/boots. 
-Edited some palettes to go along with her 'Gloves/Boots' edit (only 7).
-Edited many of her PCXs (added abs, fix colors, etc....)
-Edited the new stand animation (chest more proportionate to the rest of the sff images).
-I have made the Patch more easily to add. 
	1-Get Cammy from ChuchoRyu (make sure it's the one called 'CAmmy2014chuchoryu')
	2-Add the 'Tiger-Cammy' def file and the 'Tiger-Cammy' folder into the char.
	3-Make sure that on your Select file you have the following:
		Cammy/Tiger-Cammy.def
	4-Turn on MUGEN and Enjoy!
-BONUS!:
While editing her, I managed to create a new stand for her.
This was basically already in the sff, but seems Chuchoryu never got around to finish it. 
It needed a lot of work, but had a lot of potential. 
New Right Arm, edited her left arm, new sideways head, some special touches, and now I have a stand similar to her SF2 stand.
And YOU CHOOSE IT! On her DEF file you choose her stand animation:

;************************************
;Choose Your Stand!
;Remove ";" from the desired one.
;Add ";" in front of the other one.
;Only one must be active!

;anim    =Tiger-Cammy/Anims/AnimSF2.air;SF2 StAnce
anim    =Tiger-Cammy/Anims/AnimSF4.air;SF4 Stance

;************************************
