- Added a few more palettes for the CS
- Added 2 new Lv3 Hyper Portrait by RagingRowen
- Added 5 new big portrait by PeXXeR
- Added alternate small portrait by HadeS
- Removed a lot of unused sprites from the sff
- Re-aligned some sprites and remade some CLSN
- Fixed flipped throws
- Removed additional AIR for alternate SF2 stance (it is now changed via config.txt)
