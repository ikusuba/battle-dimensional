=====<Move Details>=====

 - Fatal Leg Twister and Cross Scissor Pressure are unblockable throws
 - Axle Spin Knuckle goes through mid-level projectiles (Hadouken and such)
 - Fatal Leg Twister can only grab grounded opponents, but Cross Scissor Pressure can grab
both grounded and jumping opponents
 - Sniping Heel will automatically attack high if you Super Cancel into it
 - At the start of Killer Bee Assault Cammy will hop to the wall instead of ceiling if the
opponent is too far up or if you selected the extra mode

=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing
   faster and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
