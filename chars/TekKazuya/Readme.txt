=====<Move Details>=====

 - Demon Slayer and Rampaging Demon don't combo on the 3rd hit, but they come out fast enough that P2 can't jump them but still block them.
 - EX Demon God Fist stuns P2, but the follow-ups from it are limited.
 - Oni Stomp and EX Spinning Demon hit OTG.
 - Autoguard is applied to before the first hit of his D, DB, B, p moves.
 - Slaughter Hook ground bounces opponents.
 - Wind God Fist allows up to 3 Juggle Points while Electric allows up to 4.
 - Electric Wind God Fist, in contrast to the normal Wind God Fist, includes invincibility, more power gain and better damage and recovery. EX Wind God Fist has similar properties but with more forward range, for easier non-corner juggles.
 - Lightning Screw Uppercut is unblockable.
 - Devil Beam's startup has Super Armor.
   
=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage

MAX MODE:
 - Your attack and defense is increased while in MAX Mode
 - EX moves can be performed at no power cost, though take away from time sustained in MAX mode
 - All Lv1 supers can be performed at no power cost, though immediately uses up all time in MAX mode
 - All Lv2 and higher supers will cost 1 power bar, along with using up all time in MAX mode
 - Even without a power bar, as long as you have time left in MAX mode, you can perform Lv1 supers/EX moves
 - You can not Power Charge/gain power while in MAX mode
 - You can not perform a Zero Counter while in MAX Mode
