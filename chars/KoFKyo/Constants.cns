victory1 = "Eat my flames of fury, wimp! Grovel before the Kusanagis!"
victory2 = "You just ain't got it. So stop whining and get lost."
victory3 = "Huh, don't tell me, you thought I was a clone?"
victory4 = "Resistance is flammable. No one can snuff my flames!"
victory5 = "Haven't you heard the expression about dancing too close to the flame...?"
