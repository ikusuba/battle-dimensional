----------------<Character Info>------------------

(**Note: 1-10 Ranking System: 1 = Lowest, 10 = Best)

 - Intelligence: 4

 - Speed: 7
 - Stamina: 6
 - Energy Projection: 1
 - Fighting Ability: 4

Poison is stronger than the average female fighter. I'd put her on par with Chun-Li in terms of endurance and strength. 
Not nearly as fast and agile however. Even so, her agility is still, like most female chars, her best trait.
Solid cancels/linking ability along with fairly decent endurance. You're still gonna want to keep your guard up though... 
While she is stronger than the average female fighter, she's still not on par with male fighters in terms of that aspect.
