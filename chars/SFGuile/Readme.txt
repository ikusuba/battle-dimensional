 - Customized version of Capcom's Guile character, for MUGEN 1.0



=====<Features>=====

 - All the essential stuff
 - Details and moves taken from his various video game appearances
 - Gameplay mixed from several games, including CvS2, KOF, SFA3 and SFIII
 - Special intros versus Charlie, Leona, Rugal Bernstein, Master Ken, and Bison Bison


=====<Super Selection>=====

This character can choose between two supers, Total Wipeout and Opening Gambit. In this character's folder, there is a file called "Config.txt". Choose which super you want to be able to perform by editing it like in the following example: 
  
[State 7650, 0 = Total Wipeout; 1 = Opening Gambit]
type = ParentVarSet
trigger1 = 1
var(40) = 0 ;CHANGE THIS LINE
 
This means that Guile will perform Total Wipeout. To make him perform Opening Gambit instead, simply change the number to the right of "var(40) = " like in the following example: 
 
[State 7650, 0 = Total Wipeout; 1 = Opening Gambit]
type = ParentVarSet
trigger1 = 1
var(40) = 1 ;CHANGE THIS LINE

=====<Move Details>=====

 - Guile High Kick juggles opponents.
 - In addition to the regular command, you can also perform Somersault Strike with the classic
   command ([charge] DB, DF, DB, UF, k).



=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage

CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start



=====<Miscellaneous>=====

- To change his size to TV aspect ratio (a.k.a. CvS scale), open the .def file and replace
  "Constants.cns" with "ConstantsCvS.cns".

- To change his voice to use CvS voices, open the .def file and replace "Sound.snd" with "SoundCvS.snd"

- To change his voice to use English SFIV voices, open the .def file and replace "Sound.snd" with
  "SoundSFIVEnglish.snd"

- If you don't like having to charge directions to perform Super moves, open the .def file and replace
  "Command.cmd" with "CommandEasy.cmd".
  All charge charge commands used in Supers will be replaced with double quarter circle motions, as follows:
	(charge) B, F, B, F     ->  D, DF, F, D, DF, F
	(charge) DB, DF, DB, U  ->  D, DB, B, D, DB, B
