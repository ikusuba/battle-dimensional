                               1.INTRODUCTION
======================================================================
Thank you for downloading this character and for actually taking the time to read this.

This is a remake of my old Kula.  She was pretty bleh back then but now I have more of an idea of what I'm doing.

This character is a non-profit fan work.  Kula Diamond and the King of Fighters series belong to SNK Playmore.
The Capcom vs SNK and Street Fighter series belong to Capcom.
I make no money from this character, nor should anyone else which means don't go selling it on Ebay in a compilation or something.
Please don't sue me, this character falls under fair use of copyrighted trademarks and I don't have a good lawyer anyway.
If you like this character (or even if you don't) please support the official products, although if you even downloaded this you should be anyway.

                               2.Q&A
======================================================================
Hopefully this section will answer any questions you may have about this character.  
Q: What's so different between the last version?
A: A list of changes would be...
-New sprites by Drex although unfinished.
-Fixed taunt
-Totally redone system mechanics.  The roll, dodge, power charge and focus attack don't function anything like they did before.
-She can now properly FADC complete with palfx and sound.
-New far fierce based on blowback attack from KOFXIII.
-Effects are part of the palette.
-New far fierce based on her new blowback from KOF XIII.
-Redone properties on all attacks for a more Capcom feel.
-Vels on basic physical stuff slightly altered for a more Capcom feel.
-Medium attacks come out faster than they did previously.
-Damage values tweaked to Capcom standards.
-Voices replaced with KOFXIII voice clips.
-Common sounds replaced with SF4 sound fx.
-KOF XIII Neomax as an ultra.  For that matter the introduction of ultras into my system.

Q: What play style does this character use?
A: My take on the whole "CVS custom" deal.  I'm not a POTS wannabe, I'm a Vyn wannabe.

Q: Why is the ultra so bare looking?
A: In XIII the neomax had a pitch black screen until the icy part itself.  I imagine in my other characters I'll have an
actual ultra background, Volzilla made a really nice looking one that I could use.

Q: Where's Guile?  And Haohmaru?  And what happened to Todoh?
A: Haohmaru I am determined to finish don't worry.  Guile I need custom sprites to continue.  Nobody cares about Todoh so I
dropped him entirely.

Q: Where's my palette?
A: In this version I omitted the palettes that use color separation since I haven't gotten all of Drex's new sprites yet.  When he finishes,
I'll update this character with them.  This is because I want to ease the pressure on him and finish this character at the same time.

Q: Didn't you quit?
A: Ok let's set the record straight once and for all, so listen and listen good.  When I left earlier this year, it was
to take care of numerous lingering issues in my personal life.   When I realized said issues had no chance of being fixed,
I decided to just say fuck it and come back.  Contrary to what certain little rodents say, I did NOT come back just to confront
Basara-Kun.  It was just an unfortunate coincidence on top of an unfortunate coincidence. The truth is, I was never going to come back,
at least not for quite a while.  I did not intend to return so soon, but I realized my personal exploits were going nowhere, so I returned.
I don't think I can be faulted for being in a shitty mood when I DID come back, but who the fuck cares what I think.
I THOUGHT that my personal life and family would take priority over Mugen, but according to the community I shouldn't even be allowed to try and 
keep things in check because I owe everyone everything yet when I confront other people I'm suddenly chopped liver.  Funny ain't it?

If you have any other questions, contact me.

                               3.CHARACTER BIO
======================================================================
Full Name: Kula Diamond
Alias: The Anti-K', The Icicle Fox, The Glacial Doll
Debut: King of Fighters 2000
Fighting Style: Anti-K' Arts 
Age: 14, 18 depending on the game
Likes: Candy
Dislikes: Fire, crowds of people
Seiyuu (Using Japanese terms makes me sound educated!): Yumi Kakazu

Kula debuted in KOF 2000 as a genetically altered NESTS assassin trained to kill K' since he was a rogue agent, but after Igniz got got in KOF 2001 and K'
and his gay biker gang buddies saved Kula and her girlfriends from that guy who looks like that guy from Akira, she turned to the side of the good guys and now 
she teams with K' and Maxima in every game because Whip sucks dick like she sucks dick.  For some reason fans like to pair her and K' up even though that's 
incest but I guess if that's your thing that's ok even though that shit's for rednecks.

======================================================================
If you really want your feedback noticed just post in the MFG release topic.  I'm mostly likely to see that.

Otherwise, shoot me an email.  theonlymc2@gmail.com

If you must upload a Youtube video showcasing a glitch I'd appreciate it if you made it unlisted instead of airing it out
to the whole fucking world.

And that's all.  Enjoy the character, leave me some feedback if you can.  Take care, spike your hair.
WWWYKI.
