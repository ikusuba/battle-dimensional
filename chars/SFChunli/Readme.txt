 - Customized version of Capcom's Chun-Li character, for MUGEN 1.0



=====<Features>=====

 - All the essential stuff
 - Details and moves taken from her various video game appearances
 - Gameplay mixed from several games, including CvS2, KOF, SFA3 and SFIII
 - Special intros versus Ryuji Yamazaki, Mai Shiranui, Yun, and evil characters.



=====<Mode Overview>=====

This character has two different modes:

<Chun-Li>
- Regular Chun-Li
- Based primarily on her SFIII/SFIV moveset

<Shadow Lady>
- A cyborg version of Chun-Li made by Shadaloo
- Based primarily on her SFA moveset, with a few extras from the MvC incarnation of Shadow Lady



=====<.DEF Overview>=====

This character has three different .def files, here's what each one does:

<CHUN-LI.def>
The mode is selected via palette:

Palettes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6    -> Chun-Li mode
Palettes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 -> Shadow Lady mode

To add her to your Mugen, add the following line to your select.def, under [Characters]:
Chun-Li,

<NORMALCHUN-LI.def>
Only Normal Chun-Li mode.
To add her to your Mugen, add the following line to your select.def, under [Characters]:
Chun-Li/NormalChun-Li.def,

<SHADOWLADY.def>
Only Shadow Lady mode.
To add her to your Mugen, add the following line to your select.def, under [Characters]:
Chun-Li/ShadowLady.def,


=====<Palette Selection and Configuration>=====

This character has an unique method of selecting palettes. In the folder "Palette Configuration", there are three text files, one for each .def file discussed above. The palettes chosen in each text file determine which palettes are able to be selected in MUGEN. Inside the "Palette Configuration" folder, there is another folder called "Palette Guides"; inside, there are images of all the avaliable palettes, each has a number in its filename. Choose what button you want the pal to be assigned by editing it like in the following example: 
 
 
[State 5900, Palette 1 (x)] 
type = VarSet 
trigger1 = PalNo = 1 
var(0) = 1 ;CHANGE THIS LINE
 
This represents the palette chosen if you select Chun-Li using the x button. Simply change the number to the right of "var(O) =" with the desired palette number. So, if you wanted the palette number 3 to be used for x you would use:
 
[State 5900, Palette 1 (x)] 
type = VarSet 
trigger1 = PalNo = 1 
var(0) = 3 ;CHANGE THIS LINE


When Shadow Lady performs a super, a spark will appear over her eye during startup, delaying the super until the spark
disappears. You can change the way Shadow Lady's super eye sparks work in the config file:

[State 5900, Shadow Lady Eye Spark (0 = Delay, 1 = No delay)]
type = VarSet
trigger1 = 1
var(1) = 0 ;CHANGE THIS LINE

If "Delay" is chosen, when Shadow Lady performs a super the super will be delayed until the eye spark disappears; if "No
delay" is chosen, the super will proceed normally.

=====<Move Details>=====

 - You can cancel out of a close standing heavy kick by performing a high jump; this also resets your juggle points.
 - Yosokyaku can be performed up to three times in succession.
 - The last button used when performing Hyakuretsukyaku determines its strength. If it is two kick
   buttons the EX version is triggered.
 - Keep tapping kick button(s) to extend (non-EX) Hyakuretsukyaku indefinitely.
 - Hyakuretsukyaku can also be performed by inputting "B, DB, D, DF, F, k"; much like the standard way of performing the move, it can
   be extended by mashing one or more of the kick button(s).
 - Sen'enshu can avoid high attacks from the start of the move until Chun-Li flips forward.
 - Hazanshu, Sen'enshu, and the final hit of Tenseiranka are overheads.
 - You can cancel out of Hoyokusen after the final hit by performing a high jump; this also resets your juggle
   points.
 - In addition to the regular command, you can also perform Hazan Tenshokyaku with the classic command
   ([charge] DB, DF, DB, UF, k).



=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster and  
   brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start



=====<Version History>=====

<v.11/29/21>
 - fixed minor guard input bug
 - New sprites added by DGO: unique jumping medium punch, SFIII styled angled jumping medium kick (normal mode only, Shadow Lady uses

 - Corrected an issue with the implementation of charge moves in the buffering system where——when cancelling into a charge special or
   super (during custom combo or when cancelling into a super in general)——a new, full charge was required; an unintended requirement   
   that was not originally present in older versions of this character.
