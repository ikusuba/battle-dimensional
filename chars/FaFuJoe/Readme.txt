=====<Move Details>=====

 - During Knees of Hades, you and your opponent can mash buttons to respectively increase or decrease the number of hits.
 - EX Slash Kick can be juggled afterwards with any attack if both hits connect.
 - Golden Heel can hit twice against airborne opponents.
 - EX Golden Heel is an overhead, and has enough frame advantage to link attacks from.
 - The last button used when performing TNT Punch determines its strength. If it is two punch buttons, the EX version is
   triggered
 - Keep tapping punch button(s) to extend TNT Punch for a limited amount of time
 - TNT Punch can also be performed by inputting "F, DF, D, DB, B, p"; much like the standard way of performing the move, it can      
   be extended by mashing one or more of the punch button(s).
 - Dynamite Fist or Dynamite Upper can be performed at any time during any strength of TNT Punch (except EX TNT Punch.)
 - Dynamite Fist is an overhead.
 - EX TNT Punch can be juggled afterwards with any attack if the last hit connects.
 - The kick used to activate (level one) Golden Tiger Kick determines its velocity.
 - The kick button can be held down to delay Golden Tiger Kick.


=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing
   faster and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
