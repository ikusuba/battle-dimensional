=====<GAMEPLAY NOTES>=====

COMBO SYSTEM
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Super moves can be canceled into other Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
 - Master Ryu can chain normal attacks in this order: X, A, Y, B, Z, C


DAMAGE SCALING
 - The damage your attacks inflict goes down with each attack in a combo
 - The first attack deals 100% damage
 - Successive attacks deal 10% less damage
 - Super cancelling a special advances 2 steps in the damage scaling
 - Super cancelling a super advances 3 steps in the damage scaling
 - Damage during Custom Combo works the same, but multiplied by 75%
 - Normal attacks deal more damage on their own than during a Chain Combo


COUNTER HITS
 - If the opponent is in the middle of attacking, your attacks deal 20% extra damage
 - Normal attacks cause extra hit stun as well, allowing links that are normally not possible
 - You'll know a counter hit happened when a round shockwave effect appears at the point of impact


FORWARD DASH
 - Moves you forward faster than walking, but you can't interrupt it
 - Useful for sneaking up on the opponent


RUN
 - Can be interrupted unlike dashes


BACK DASH
 - Creates some space between you and the opponent
 - Considered airborne, so it avoids most throws and standing combos


LOW JUMP
 - Useful for quick jumping attacks that must be blocked high
 - Cannot use special and super moves while low jumping
 - Delay after attacking is longer than other jumps


HIGH JUMP
 - Useful for quickly closing distance
 - If the opponent is in the corner, this allows you to cross him up


LONG LOW JUMP
 - A cross between Low and High jumps


SIDESTEP
 - Avoids all attacks and fireballs
 - Vulnerable to throws
 - Instant recovery


SIDESTEP ATTACK
 - Allows you to counterattack after dodging
 - Between the punch and kick options, one can be cancelled into special and super moves, and the other knocks down


ROLL
 - Avoids all attacks and fireballs while moving
 - Vulnerable to throws
 - Can be hit by anything at the end of the animation
 - Forward version is a bit faster than the back version


PARRY
 - Allows you to bypass block stun, leaving the opponent open for a counterattack
 - To parry high attacks tap forward just before being hit. To parry low attacks tap down. While jumping only forward works


POWER CHARGE
 - Manually charges the power meter
 - Rate of charge is slow at first, but increases the longer you hold it


GUARD CANCEL
 - While guarding, this cancels out of the guarding pose with a counterattack
 - Useful to relieve pressure


CUSTOM COMBO
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start


FALL RECOVERY
 - Allows you to land on your feet after being knocked down



=====<OTHER INFO>=====

<Selecting the win pose>
(Speech translations by Kibagami)

Normal/Master Ryu:
X or A -> Ryu raises his arm and says "Ore no kachi da!" ("Victory is mine!").
Y      -> Ryu crosses his arms and asks the opponent if he still feels like standing up.
B      -> Ryu crosses his arms silently as a leaf blows away in the wind
C or Z -> Ryu practices his Hadouken stance one more time.

Evil Ryu:
X, Y or Z -> Ryu turns his back and says "Shin no tsu, tometekureru!" ("I will stop your
heartbeat!").
A, B or C -> Ryu stomps the ground and says "Zetsu!" ("Death!").


<Extra win poses>

Normal Ryu:
Win by Shin Shoryuken -> Ryu turns his back on the opponent.

Evil Ryu:
Win by Ryuu Koku Hadou Ken -> Ryu falls on his knees, exhausted.
Win by Shun Goku Satsu -> Ryu has his back turned, breathing heavily, saying "Ware, Kobushi
kiwame tari..." ("I mastered my fist...") while the Metsu kanji is displayed in the background.

Master mode has all of the above.
